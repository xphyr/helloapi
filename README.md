# Hello World API app

This is a small go application that does one thing... says "Hello world from \<OS Goes Here\>" where OS is the value of runtime.GOOS.

Why would I want to do such a thing ... I have my reasons :)

This uses the minimalist go language primatives as it needs to compile with Go 1.4.3 for my usecase.
